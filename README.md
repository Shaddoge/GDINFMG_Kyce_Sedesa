This project is an attempt to replicate the Trading House System of the game Dragon Nest while using a custom backend server that the group has made.
The User Interface of the project is similar to the proposed wireframes in MCO1 with a few differences depending on the circumstances in the creation of the project.
The user also has the ability to edit an existing player's name if they are not an admin and they are able to create a new player, item, and inventory item for a player if they are an admin.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
